# code_challenge_lds_church

code_challenge_lds_church is a frontend react-redux app that sets up the structure for displaying articles and news events.

## Overview of Project
I started the project out by creating a specification sheet for the structure and functionality of the app. Due to the limited timeframe to work on this project, I did my best to complete as many of the specification as I could while focusing on the primary specifications outlined in the project assignment.

- I started out the project by developing a back-end using JSON objects and a fake api for imitating data requests and promises.
- I then built a navigation header and dashboard page for navigating through the different areas of the app.
- I spent most of the time focusing on the Article and Tile page design to make them responsive and meet the assignment specifications.
- I was unable to complete the following specifications that I wrote out in the allotted time.
	- Log in and flow feature (completed back-end and redux actions but didn't start front-end)
	- Ability for admin user to add and update articles and tiles (completed back-end and redux actions but didn't start front-end)
	- Ability to search and navigate to articles and tiles from search bar (started but didn't complete)
	- Include unit tests for all components (all unit tests pass, but only wrote a few for the main App component)
